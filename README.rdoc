== SERIMI â€“ Resource Description Similarity, RDF Instance Matching and Interlinking  
   
The interlinking of datasets published in the Linked Data Cloud is a 
challenging problem and a key factor for the success of the Semantic Web. 
Manual rule-based methods are the most effective solution for the problem, but 
they require skilled human data publishers going through a laborious, error 
prone and time-consuming process for manually describing rules mapping 
instances between two datasets. Thus, an automatic approach for solving this 
problem is more than welcome. In this paper, we propose a novel interlinking 
method, SERIMI, for solving this problem automatically. SERIMI matches 
instances between a source and a target datasets, without prior knowledge of the 
data, domain or schema of these datasets. Experiments conducted with 
benchmark collections demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms 
state-of-the-art automatic approaches for solving the interlinking problem on 
the Linked Data Cloud. 

In this repository we encounter the SERIMI interlinking script. 
We also encounter the reference alignment for Dailymed-TCM that we fixed.

== Installation instructions

Serimi ONLY works over Virtuoso Sparql Endpoints. Therefore, you need to load your data on a Virtuoso Openlink server (download here [http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtuoso/files/]) if you want to use this tool.

== Usage

Usage: serimi.rb [options] 

Example of use: 
ruby serimi.rb -s http://localhost:8890/sparql -t http://dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=http://dbpedia.org -c http://www.semwebtech.
